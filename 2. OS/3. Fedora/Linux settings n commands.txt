Remember to check CPU vulnerability mitigations

This also affects Windows 10, but it doesn't expose this information or mitigation instructions as easily. MacOS users check How to enable full mitigation for Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) vulnerabilities on Apple Support.

When running a recent enough Linux kernel, you can check the CPU vulnerabilities it detects by tail -n +1 /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/*. By using tail -n +1 instead of cat, the file names are also visible.

In case you have an Intel CPU, you may notice "SMT vulnerable" display after running the tail command. To mitigate this, disable hyper-threading from the UEFI/BIOS. You can also take the following mitigation steps below if your system/distribution uses GRUB and supports /etc/default/grub.d/:

    sudo mkdir /etc/default/grub.d/ to create a directory for additional grub configuration
    echo GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT l1tf=full,force mds=full,nosmt mitigations=auto,nosmt nosmt=force" | sudo tee /etc/default/grub.d/mitigations.cfg to create a new grub config file source with the echoed content
    sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg to generate a new grub config file including these new kernel boot flags
    sudo reboot to reboot
    after the reboot, check tail -n +1 /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/* again to see that everything referring to SMT now says "SMT
